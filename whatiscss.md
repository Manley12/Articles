## What is CSS. and Why Is It Important?

CSS is a very important part of the modern web. CSS actually stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Modern web pages use HTML5 in conjunction with CSS to make amazing, beautiful websites. Without CSS website would look plain, uninteresting and dated in today's standard. 

### Brief History of CSS
CSS was first presented as an idea at The Web Conference of 1994 in Chicago. It received some critisism as some argued that to style documents a full programmming language was needed while CSS was just a simple, declarative format ([w3.org](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html)). At the next conference in 1995, CSS was again presented, this time with implmentations to showcase. Despite the want and need it would not be until a year later that CSS level 1 become ratified and accepted as a W3C Recommendation in December of 1996.

The current official version of CSS 3. This version split CSS into modules, which have been allowed to level independently, allowing some modules to progress to level 4 ([A Word About CSS4](https://www.xanthir.com/b4Ko0)).
