<ul>
  <li><i>1xx informational response</i> - the request has been received and continuing process</li>
  <li><i>2xx successful</i> - the request has been received, understood, and accepted</li>
  <li><i>3xx redirection<i> - further action is needed in order to complete the request</li>
  <li><i>4xx client error<i> - the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled</li>

</ul>
