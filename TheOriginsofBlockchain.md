## The Origins of Blockchain
The first blockchain application was started by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3, 2009. While we do not know the actual identity or identities of Satoshi Nakamoto, we do know the blockchain application known as Bitcoin. Bitcoin is credited with being the first blockchain. 

But what is the origin of blockchain technology?

### First Work on Blockchain
Two Bellcore Researchers, [Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00196791), started work on the first cryptographically secured chain (would become known as blockchain). They wanted to create a system that would create timestamps for documents that could not be tampered with. 

### What is Blockchain?
According to [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/what-is-blockchain), blockchain technology is "a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust". By storing information in a peer-to-peer network, blockchains are decentralized. This decentralization prevents many attacks that could arise from a centralized network. For example, it attempts to mitigate double-spending, mutilating previous blocks, malicious client code, among others. 

Blocks in a blockchain holds information on the chain. For Bitcoin, the block holds a version descriptor, the previous block's unique hash, the transaction details, the current time, and a target value. This complete block is then hashed with an arbitrary number, finishing with a hash that is lower than the target value and thus being added to the chain and verified by the node on the network. 

### Satoshi Nakamoto's Chain
Satoshi Nakamoto released the first [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) on October 31, 2008. In it, he envisioned a "purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash [that] would allow online payments to be sent directly for one party to another without going through a financial institution". He purposed a system that has became Bitcoin and then took off from there. 

Bitcoin lead way to many cryptocurrencies, but not all cryptocurrencies are just about the money, some have built applications into the chain such as Ethereum building smart contracts. These contracts are simply code that runs on the Ethereum chain and can be used to create [DApps](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/what-is-ethereum/#what-are-smart-contracts-and-decentralized-applications) which can include games, digital collectables, online-voting, and many others. 

The applications of blockchain technology is expanding. When blockchains first started with Bitcoin, the technology was not taken seriously. Now that the technology has been vetted and verified, companies have start using blockchains for uses other than cryptocurrencies.
