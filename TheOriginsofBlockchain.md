## The Origins of Blockchain
The first blockchain application was started by Satoshi Nakamoto on January 3, 2009. While we do not know the actual identity or identities of Satoshi Nakamoto, we do know the blockchain application known as Bitcoin. Bitcoin is credited with being the first blockchain. 

But what is the origin of blockchain technology?

### First Work on Blockchain
Two Bellcore Researchers, [Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00196791), started work on the first cryptographically secured chain (would become known as blockchain). They wanted to create a system that would create timestamps for documents that could not be tampered with. 

### What is Blockchain?
According to [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/what-is-blockchain), blockchain technology is "a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust". 

### Satoshi Nakamoto's Chain
Satoshi Nakamoto released the first [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) on October 31, 2008. In it, he envisioned a "purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash [that] would allow online payments to be sent directly for one party to another without going through a financial institution". He purposed a system that has became Bitcoin and then took off from there.
