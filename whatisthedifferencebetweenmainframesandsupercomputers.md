## What is The Difference Between Mainframes and Supercomputers?

What do you picture when you here the word mainframe or supercomputer? Most people think of a very similar picture, which is not surprising if you look at the definitions of the words. According to the Oxford Dictionary, a mainframe is:

<blockquote>main·frame: /'mān,frām/ (<i>noun</i>)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p font-family="Snell Roundhand Script">
        a large high-speed computer, especially one supporting numerous workstations or periphals
    </p>
</blockquote>

And a supercomputer is:

<blockquote>su·per·com·put·er: /ˈso͞opərkəmˌpyo͞odər/ (<i>noun</i>)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p font-family="Snell Roundhand Script">
        a particularly powerful mainframe computer
    </p>
</blockquote>

So, based on Oxford a supercomputer is just a powerful mainframe computer. But is this actually the case?
