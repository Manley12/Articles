## What is The Difference Between Mainframes and Supercomputers?

What do you picture when you here the word mainframe or supercomputer? Most people think of a very similar picture, which is not surprising if you look at the definitions of the words. According to the Oxford Dictionary, a mainframe is:

<blockquote>main·frame: /'mān,frām/ (<i>noun</i>)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p font-family="Snell Roundhand Script">
        a large high-speed computer, especially one supporting numerous workstations or periphals
    </p>
</blockquote>

And a supercomputer is:

<blockquote>su·per·com·put·er: /ˈso͞opərkəmˌpyo͞odər/ (<i>noun</i>)</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p font-family="Snell Roundhand Script">
        a particularly powerful mainframe computer
    </p>
</blockquote>

So, based on Oxford a supercomputer is just a powerful mainframe computer. But is this actually the case?

### So What Is The Difference?

Mainframes are powerful computers that have handled mission-critical business workloads for decades, being in use from the 1950s. Mainframes have been replaced with server for many applications, but is still common in industries like banking, telecommunications, and retail. Many new mainframes, like the IBM z15, are only about the size of a supercomputer.

A supercomputer is a multi node system that uses parallel processing to run a program or simulation at extremely fast speeds. Supercomputers, due to the definition can be as small as two computers (even laptops) or even as big as a warehouse or bigger. 

According to [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-supercomputer-and-mainframe-computer/) the main differences between supercomputers and mainframes are:

<table>
	<th></th>
    <th>Supercomputer</th>
    <th>Mainframe</th>
    <tr>
    	<td>1.</td>
        <td>Supercomputers are used for large and compex mathematical computations</td>
        <td>Mainframes are used as a storage for large database and serve a maximum number of users at a time</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>2.</td>
        <td>Some of the fastest supercomputers operates at hundreds of quadillions of FLoating-point Operations Per Second (FLOPS)</td>
        <td>On the other hand, mainframes generally only operates at tens of millions of these operations</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    	<td>3.</td>
        <td>Both supercomputers and mainframes will generally run a Linux based OS.</td>
