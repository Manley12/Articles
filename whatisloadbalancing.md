## What is Load Balancing

Modern internet infastructure requires mutliple computers in order to serve a website or internet application reliably around the globe. But each of these computers have a different external IP addresses. While this would not be a problem if all of the computer hosted a different application, DNS (Domain Name Server) and mobile applications rely on a single IP to connect to.

### What Does a Load Balancer Do?
According to [NGINX](https://www.ngnix.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/), "a load balancer acts as the "traffic cop" sitting in front of your servers and routing client request across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilizatiojnand ensures that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance."
