## A Brief History of C

There are many programming languages in use today. One of which is called C. There are many offshoots of the C progamming language, including Objective-C, C++, and C#. None of these are the same language. 

### The Beginning
The C programming language came out of Bell Labs in the early 1970s. 

### Uses Today
According to [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/c/after-all-these-years-the-world-is-still-powered-by-c-programming), UNIX operating systems are written in C and most of Linux is also in C. Also databases such s Oracle Database, MySQL, MS SQL Server, and PostgresSQL are at least partially written in C.

C has changed over the years and is still a common language to use in lower level programs, like kernels.
