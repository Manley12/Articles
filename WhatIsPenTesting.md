### What Is Pen Testing and Why Is It Important? 

Pen Testing, also known as penetration testing, is the method of planning attacks against security infrastructure or computer program to find security vulnerabilities that need to be patched. Pen testing comes in many forms and contains different specialities. So, what exactly is penetration and why is it important?

## What Exactly Does Pen Testing Entail? 

Pen testing can entail the use of multiple software tools or even brand new own that the test may create for the specific application. The [National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/penetration-testing) defines penetration testing as, "A method for gaining assurance in the security of an IT system by attempting to breach some or all of that system's security, using the same tools and techniques as an adversary might."

Testing generally includes the following process:
  1. Reconnaissance  
    - The process of gathering important information on a target system.
  2. Scanning  
    - The use of technical tools to further the knowledge of the system.
  3. Gaining Access  
    - Using the gathered data to make a payload to exploit the whole system, or a certain part of a system.
  4. Maintaining Access  
    - Continuing to be within the target environment, may be by evaluating the attackers own permissions
  5. Covering Tracks  
    - Clearing any trace of the attackers doing on the target system, generally includes deleting logs and removing all data gathered.

There are many penetration testing operating system that are made to aid in testing. Some notable ones are [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org), [BlackArch Linux](https://blackarch.org), and [BackBox Linux](https://www.backbox.org). Each of which comes with a whole suite of penetration testing software built-in and ready to use. 

## Why Is Pen Testing Important?

Zero-day vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that are generally unknown to the owner of the computer system. These can lead to extreme consequences as they could be exploited before a patch is possible becoming zero-day exploits. 

Pen testing can also give the security personnel experience in dealing with attackers. It can help these personnel discover ways to effectively and quickly remove attackers from the system before they can do any damage. Also, testing can give developers/creators a insight into their systems. They could be shown that their application is vulnerable in a certain way and if an exploit was created for that vulnerability how it could be fixed or at a minimum mitigated. 

Penetration Testing, or pen testing for short, is simply the process by which professional ethical hackers attack system in order to find or even exploit security vulnerabilities that may be present in a computer system. After which the developers/creators of the system can begin to work on a patch that would close the vulnerability.
