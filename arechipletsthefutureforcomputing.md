## Are Chiplets the Future for Computing?

### Processor Designs
For many many years, CPUs have been made based upon a monolithic design. This processor followed Moore's Law, which says that the number of transistors will double every two years. It is now being said that Moore's Law is coming to an end, especially with monolithic designs. According to (Interesting Engineering)[https://interestingengineering.com/no-more-transistors-the-end-of-moores-law], there are three major factors that contribute to the slowing rate of growth in processing power, being electrical leakage, heat, and economics.
