## What is RISC?
The Central Processing Unit Architecture operates using an instruction set architecture. RISC, or Reduced Instruction Set Computer, is a type of microprocessor architecture that uses a small, highly-optimized set of instructions. 

### Origins of RISC
RISC architecture started in the late 1970s. According to [Standford](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/whatis/index.html), the first RISC projects came from IBM, Standford, and UC-Berkeley.



### How is RISC Different From the Current CISC
According to [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/risc-reduced-instruction-set-computer), RISC has five design principles:
<ul>
  <li>Single-cycle execution</li>
  <li>Hard-wired control, little or no microcode</li>
  <li>Simple instructions, few addressing modes</li>
  <li>Load and store, register-register design</li>
  <li>Efficient, deep pipelining</li>
</ul>

This means that RISC emphasises software abd favors more transistors for storing memory. This is in contrast to CISC which emphasises hardware and used many transistors for storing complex instructions. RISC also has less steps between macghine instructions and execution. RISC only has machine instructions leding to instruction execution, while CISC has machine instructions to microcode conversion to microinstruction then microinstruction execution. 

### RISC in Today's Computers
There are many computer systems that take advantage of a RISC processor. Some notable ones are the A13 Bionic, which powers all iPhone 11 models, the A12X Bionic, which powers the iPad Pro, and
