## What is RISC?
The Central Processing Unit Architecture operates using an instruction set architecture. RISC, or Reduced Instruction Set Computer, is a type of microprocessor architecture that uses a small, highly-optimized set of instructions. 

### Origins of RISC
RISC architecture started in the late 1970s. According to [Standford](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/whatis/index.html), the first RISC projects came from IBM, Standford, and UC-Berkeley.

### How is RISC Different From the Current CISC
According to [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/risc-reduced-instruction-set-computer), RISC has five design principles:
<ul>
  <li>Single-cycle execution</li>
  <li>Hard-wired control, little or no microcode</li>
  <li>Simple instructions, few addressing modes</li>
  <li>Load and store, register-register design</li>
  <li>Efficient, deep pipelining</li>
</ul>
