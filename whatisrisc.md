## What is RISC?
RISC, or Reduced Instruction Set Computer, is a type of microprocessor architecture that uses a small, highly-optimized set of instructions. 

### Origins of RISC
RISC architecture started in the late 1970s. According to [Standford](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/risc/whatis/index.html), the first RISC projects came from IBM, Standford, and UC-Berkeley.
