### What is WEP

### Why Is It Bad to Use
This is reminiscent of high school, when the STEM Lab teacher setup a few computers with Kali Linux installed. He also created a WEP WiFi access point for the students. This was so that the students could learn how to use Fern Wifi Cracker and similar sotware to creack the insecure WEP access point and see how much hard WPA/WPA2-PSK access points were to crack.
