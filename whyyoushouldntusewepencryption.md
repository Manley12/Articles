## Why You Shouldn't Use WEP Encryption
There are many encryption standards in the world today. Unfortunately, many standards that are considerable insecure are still being used in sensative applications. One such standard is WEP, so what is it and why is it bad to use?

### What is WEP
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security algorithm for wireless networks. It was introduced as a part of the original 802.11 standard that was ratified in 1997. Since this standard was an early-day solution its goal was to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks, which it did for a time. 

The standard was superseded by Wi-Fi Protected Access in 2003, with WPA2 the following year. The IEEE declared in 2004 that both WEP-40 and WEP-104, "have been deprecated as they fail to meet their security goals". Despite this, WEP is still used, even in high end wireless routers such as the ASUS ROG Rapture AX11000 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6 Router.

### Why Is It Bad to Use
This is reminiscent of high school, when the STEM Lab teacher setup a few computers with Kali Linux installed. He also created a WEP WiFi access point for the students. This was so that the students could learn how to use Fern Wifi Cracker and similar sotware to creack the insecure WEP access point and see how much hard WPA/WPA2-PSK access points were to crack.
