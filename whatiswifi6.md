## What Is WiFi 6?

Almost every smartphone can connect to the internet via WiFi and all modern laptops connect through WiFi since they do not have a RJ45 Ethernet port. The current version of WiFi is called 802.11ac. Wi-Fi 6 is also known as AX WiFi or 802.11ax WiFi. But how is this standard different than the previous and is it needed?

### How is WiFi 6 Different From 802.11ac?
According to [CISCO](www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/wireless/what-is-wi-fi-6.html) WiFi 6 is "the latest step in a journey of nonstop innovation. The standard builds on the strengths of 802.11ac while adding efficiency, flexibility, and scalability that allows new and existing networks increased speed and capacity with next-generation applications." One of the biggest advantages of WiFi 6 is the ability to support more clients in dense environement. Along with this, it expands the WiFi bands from 80 MHz to 160 MHz, which according to [TP-Link](www.tp-link.com/us/wifi6) doubles the channel width and creates "a faster connection from your router to the device".

The standard also utilizes OFDMA, or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access, which allows data transmission signals to be split into smaller signals meaning that the router does not have to wait for medium access for every packet. According to [NETGEAR](kb.netgear.com/000059685/What-is-Orthogonal-Frequency-Division-Multiple-Access), benefits from using OFDMA include:
<ul>
  <li>Improved data transmission between every device in your network</li>
  <li>Greatly improved network efficiency (less waiting for data transmission)</li>
  <li>Greatly improved latency for small packet transmission</li>
  <li>Improved communication between your router and your devices</li>
  <li>Improved battery life for your devices</li>
</ul>

WiFi 6 includes advanced security protocols and requires Wi-Fi Certified WPA3. 

### Why is WiFi 6 needed?
According to the [Wi-Fi Alliance](www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-certified-6-delivers-new-wi-fi-era) WiFi 6 supports "a more diverse set of devices and applications, from those requiring peak performance in demanding enterprise environments to those requiring low power nad low latency in smart homes or industrial IoT scenarios... [It] delivers nearly four times the capacity of [802.11ac], and is an evolutionary advancement. [WiFi 6] delivers critical connectivity that supports cellular networks, and leverages high speeds, low latency, power efficiency, greater capacity, and enhanced coverage to deliver many advanced 5G services."
