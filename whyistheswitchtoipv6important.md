## Why is the Switch to IPv6 Important?

Computer talk to other computers all the time, but how cana they tell who is who? This is where IP addresses come in. Each computer on a network receives an IP address which, can be thought as the unique name of the computer, much like a mailing address identifies given people. Currently, we are using IPv4 addresses to tell computers apart, but we need to transition to IPv6 soon.

### How Is IPv6 Different?
IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses allowing for a total of 4,294,967,296 (2^32) addresses. That is the big problem with continuing to use IPv4. According to the World Bank, the population of Earth is 7.53 billion as of 2017. Assuming 1/2 of these peopl own an internet connected device, we still have about half a billion addresses left over. However, it is common today for people to have more than one internet connected device, like having a smartphone and a laptop and this does not include server farms or cryptocurrency mining operations. This amount of devices has overwhelmed the amount of addresses available in IPv4.  
IPv6 on the other hand uses 128-bit addresses, allowing 3.4 x 10^38 or  340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 addresses. This would mean that we will almost never run out of addresses. 

Smart devices, like a smart lock, smart speaker, smart TVs, and any other "smart" internet connected device, are assigned an IP address. This takes up an available address and thus creating the need for IPv6. There is not addresses in IPv4 to support all of these devices.
