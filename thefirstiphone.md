## The First iPhone

Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled a phone that completely changed the smartphone industry on January 9, 2007. 

"Well, today we're introducing three revolutionary products of this class. The first one is a widescreen iPod with touch controls. The second is a revolutionary mobile. The third is a breakthrough Internet communications device. These are not three separate devices. This is one device. and we are calling it iPhone. Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone," said Steve Jobs

The original iPhone did not use a keyboard like almost all modern smartphones and also did not have a stylus. Instead, the device utilized brand new technology that we take for granted tody called Multitouch.
